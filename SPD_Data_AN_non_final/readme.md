# Pokemon Data Analysis

Link to Article - [Pokemon, a Shallow Analysis](https://medium.com/@lukazphelps/pok%C3%A9mon-the-best-seller-a-shallow-analysis-1176daa8b038)

> Within this project I have analyzed internal pokemon data in regards to:

- Stats of individual pokemon
- Generation and number of introductions
- Typings
- Categorical Status

> Within the Article linked hereafter I have also conducted analysis in regards to:

- Total sales
- Trends in Data
- Pre-determined assumptions based on commonly accepted data
- Post-determined conclusion based on analysis of current data in regards to pre determined assumptions

> ###### Information found in the analysis and the article, while related, are not explicitly complimentary in all respects. After completing the original analysis, it is clear that not all information gleaned within was useful and/or required for the assumptions and conclusion reached. It is suggested to view the article and inner analysis as seperate entities except where directly connected/complimentary.

My goal in this project is to take a data set that I find personally interesting and apply anylytical thinking to have some predictable outcome.

I, as the writer of this article, have some inner knowledge of the relationship between some of the patterns and trends herein, however I assert that I have provided explanation, visual aid, data, and or links to any information a reader may need to comprehend any assumption or conclusion brought forth within the article.
